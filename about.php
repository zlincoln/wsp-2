			<h1>About HG Skis</h1>
			<p>"HG Skis is the east coast's premier up and coming ski company. We build skis to improve our own experience, and then we apply it to the skiers around us. As we begin to sell skis we consider all of our clients test pilots. We provide them with the very best ski, and they provide us with their opinions and recommendations."</p>
			<p>-------------</p>
			<p>HG Skis is a freestyle ski company based in Burlington, VT. While we've been building and designing skis since 2006, the company was officially established in 2010. In the age of "locally grown products" and "micro-brew" ski companies, the east coast has been left without its own ski brand. As the only representatives of the east coast in the ski industry, we design, prototype, and manufacture product specifically for our terrain.</p>
			<p>In 2006 I began work on a senior project in high school. Over a five month process I built a ski press, a mold, and many of the specialized ski tools still used by the company today. Above all I built a pair of skis that I am still in love with.</p>
			<p>For my first two years of college I was in an out of other peoples' shop space. It was not until my go-to shop told me that I wasn't allowed back that I decided to invest in my own machines, and start a ski company. During my third year of college I befriend Connor Gaeta. Connor originally started with me to develop our first twin tip, and function as a pro.</p>
			<p>Since then, Connor has developed into a major component of the company. The two of us are very different people, but we  share one major thing in common. We are crazy about skiing, and want to bring innovation to the sport in anyway possible.</p>
			<p>Currently we work out of a garage in Burlington, Vermont. We live in your neighborhood, and we are building our favorite skis for you.</p>
