From then it's grown out of a dingy garage in downtown Burlington to a real shop. I am always trying to see how I can change my personal style to reflect in HG itself. Working with HG really allows everything we do on the snow reflect in the company itself.</p>");

I started skiing when I was about 2 and was racing up until I was 11. I always had a love for freestyle skiing ever since I ditched my ski group to take park laps. The first couple of years for me consisted on expanding my bag of tricks and dialing them down consistently.</p>");

Moved to Burlington, Vermont over the summer to change things up a bit and ski at Sugarbush this season with the whole HG crew! Shout outs to the boys at HG, YMR, Dan at Arsenic Apparel, Ian at Kingdom Softwear, and all the friends and family that helped me along the way.</p>");

I skied on weekends and after school, or I snowskated in my back yard if I couldn't get on the hill. In high school I built a pair of skis for the first time as a senior project. Two years later when I blew the circuit for the whole floor in my dorm I decided it was time to focus on just the skis!</p>");

My last 2 years of high school I started making ski movies with my friend George Watts, and since then I have found skiing coming before almost anything else. Its great to work with a team of equally passionate people here at HG Skis, and as our riders progress, so does our video production. I work on the graphics, videos, and photography - putting in the hours behind the appearance of our products. My video production partner in crime, Sam Rogers, and of course, the team riders, will be hard at work getting you the best quality videos in the 12/13 season that your going to have to watch twice to comprehend. Be sure to say hello if you see us riding/filming!</p>");
