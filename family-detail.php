				<p>I got started with HG about 3 years ago well it was still in its infancy stages. From then it's grown out of a dingy garage in downtown Burlington to a real shop. I am always trying to see how I can change my personal style to reflect in HG itself. Working with HG really allows everything we do on the snow reflect in the company itself.</p>
